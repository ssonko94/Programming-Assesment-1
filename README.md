In this exercise I will create 3 modules which will be contain functions that will carry out some python I/O operations.

1.  Module 1 (CSV_CREATOR) -> This will contain a funtion that creates csv files and putting in content
2.  Module 2 (CSV_FILE_CONTENT_READER) -> This module will contain a function that takes in a csv file and reads it's content
